QC Notes
========

## schema ##

+ why are numeric values strings?
+ why do we enumerate boolean as Yes/No and 1/0 but not true/false?
+ why is there more than one boolean representation?
+ why do Yes/No appear in non-boolean contexts?
+ why does homozygosity_yn exist rather than is_homozygous?
+ why does "is_standard" show up in the sds json but not in the schema?
+ why is the value for "is_standard" 1 rather than true or "YES"?
+ why is species enum such a train wreck?

## mmrrc_id ##

All 69886 have a unique id used exactly once.

## doc_title ##

95% of records do not have a doc_title. Among those that do, there are some
duplicate titles that look like typos.

+ "" 66402
+ " " 0

## published_name ##

Appears to be a comma separated list, sometimes with genotype. Some of the
lists have trailing commas. Some names don't look like publshed names.

+ "" 38939
+ " " 11320

Really?

+ "inbred High Drinking in the Dark - replicate 2 (iHDID-2)"
+ "Dsgsqk" is probably Dsg3<sup>sqk</sup>
+ "C57BL/6J-Matr3^em3Lutzy/Mmjax" do we allow ^?
+ "<em>Mr.Magoo</em>" is that really a mouse name?
+ "<em>zeitgeist,Â <span>Med30</span><sup><span>zg</span></sup></em>"
+ "<p>129S4/SvJae-Fgfr2tm5.1Sor, Fgfr2&lt;PG&gt;</p>"
+ "This strain was formerly available as <a href..."

Exploring further...

+ split records into those with and without html tags
	+ illegal vs. legal html tags
	+ <i> vs. <em>
	+ &
+ split into CSD...
+ leading and trailing spaces
+ trailing commas or comma-space
+ legal and illegal characters: ^ *
+ very long descriptions
+ hard <CR>
+ KOMP label, usually with CDS


Names like CSD40482 appear in many records. Are these published names because
they don't come up in a google search.

Dead records you can get from API but not from website. This happens when
sds_status is N/A. There are 655 at this point.
