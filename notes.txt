QC Notes
========

## schema ##

+ why are numeric values strings?
+ why do we enumerate boolean as "Yes"/"No" and "1"/"0" but not true/false?
+ why is there more than one boolean representation?
+ why do Yes/No appear in non-boolean contexts?
+ why does homozygosity_yn exist rather than is_homozygous?
+ why does "is_standard" show up in the sds json but not in the schema?
+ why is there a species enum rather than a tax_id?
+ why are empty lists represented as empty strings?
+ why is the SDS data on the website different from the json?

## mmrrc_id ##

All 69886 have a unique id used exactly once.

## doc_title ##

95% of records do not have a doc_title. Among those that do, there are some
duplicate titles that look like typos.

+ '' 66402
+ ' ' 0

Typos

+ 31781: 31781 32781
+ 31782: 31782 32782
+ 31778: 31778 32778
+ 31779: 31779 32779

## published_name ##

Appears to be a comma separated list, sometimes with genotype. Some of the
lists have trailing commas. Some names don't look like publshed names.

+ '' 38939
+ ' ' 11320

Ideas to dive deeper

+ split records into those with and without html tags
	+ illegal vs. legal html tags
	+ <i> vs. <em>
	+ &
+ split into CSD...
+ leading and trailing spaces
+ trailing commas or comma-space
+ legal and illegal characters: ^ *
+ very long descriptions
+ hard <CR>
+ KOMP label, usually with CDS

Names like CSD40482 appear in many records. Are these published names because
they don't come up in a google search.

There are a bunch of test pages you can get from API but not website. All of
these have sds_status N/A, but many valid records also have this property. How
do you find these records better?

+ 'Best Strain Ever, BSE' 37127 37084
+ '., .' 37630 36970 36971

+ '1, 1' 36824 36817 36816 36747

## genetic_alteration ##

Looks like this is up to the submitter, but we can normalize afterwards

+ '' 37122
+ ' ' 21
+ 'intragenic deletion' is spelled with various captialization schemes
+ many variations on KOMP descriptions that appear similar

## genotyping ##

+ 'Not characterized.' 6

Lots of html tags (many useless), extra spaces

## founder_background ##

String because who knows how it originated, but current background should be
from a list of known strains, right?

+ '' 65200
+ ' ' 1
+ lots of backgrounds, but hard to tell if any have errors

## current_background ##

+ '' 37118
+ ' ' 21
+ lots of backgrounds, how do they compare to legal enums?

## strain_development ##

+ '<p>Array</p>' 7  look at record 420
+ 'a' 6

Stuff with hard <cr>
Lots of long paragraphs with similar content. How many are the same thing?

## research_applications ##

Why do we store lists as html rather than actual lists?

+ '' 65148
